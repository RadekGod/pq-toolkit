# Perceptual Qualities Toolkit

## What is going on?
This project came to life as a part of WIMU lecture @ [WUT's](https://www.pw.edu.pl) [Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](https://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/).

The main goal was to create a toolkit that allows to perform [_AB_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), [_ABX_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABX_test), [_APE_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273574027_APE_Audio_Perceptual_Evaluation_toolbox_for_MATLAB) and [_MUSHRA_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSHRA) tests on user-provided audio material.

## Project structure
This project consist of 2 main parts: 

- Python module, 
- web application testing platform.

The former allows user to create, setup, configure and delete experiments.
The latter helps to conduct experiments in accessible way with end users.
