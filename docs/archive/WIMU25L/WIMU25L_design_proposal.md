# Planned Features

---

The goal of the project is to expand and modernize the pq-toolkit tool, which is used for conducting experiments related to evaluating the perceptual qualities of audio.
As part of the work, the plan includes not only developing the main project repository but also reviewing and potentially integrating selected changes proposed in the previous semester (2024Z) that have not yet been merged into the main code branch.

The project work will begin with organizing the repository, including:

- Reviewing and standardizing the directory structure,

- Updating and supplementing the technical and user documentation,

- Refactoring the source code to improve readability, consistency, and ease of future development.

The next step will be the implementation of a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) system using GitHub Actions, allowing automation of the testing, building, and deployment process for new tool versions.

In the later phases of the project, the focus will be on improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). Planned improvements include:

- Simplifying the process of defining and launching experiments,

- Facilitating access to test and experiment results (in CSV and PDF formats),

- Enhancing the presentation of results, including adding visualizations and user feedback.

All activities aim to increase the usability, stability, and scalability of the tool while facilitating its further development and maintenance.
